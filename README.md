#Replacing Unknown Continuous Values as a Factor in Training Machine Learning Models for Binary Classification


A particularly interesting field of Data Science, among others, is the handling of NaN (Not
a Number) values which may be found in the data under examination. NaN values may exist
in the data for various reasons, but the main reason is that something went wrong while
collecting the data. For example a sensor did not work as expected.
The way we handle such values,plays a significant role in the process of making predictions
and discovering hidden knowledge from the data. In most of the cases, we decide to ignore
NaN values, however we may replace them, using a specific strategy or keep them, as there
are algorithm build to process and handle NaN values. The subject of this thesis is to examine
how changes in the quality of data, specifically the replacement of NaN continuous values,
affect the accuracy of binary classification tasks. In fact, we examine how the accuracy of
various machine learning classification algorithms-models fluctuates by ignoring NaN values
and by replacing them with specific strategies, using the techniques of grid search and cross
validation.
